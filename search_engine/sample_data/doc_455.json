By Dec. 8, 2019, several cases in Wuhan, China had been reported with most patients working at or living around the local Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (Chen et al., 2020) . After Dec. 8, the number of patients increased rapidly, although many patients had not been in or near the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. During the same period of time, many Wuhan residents began leaving the city to return to their hometowns to join with family to celebrate Spring Festival, the Chinese New Year. As a result of the overlap of emergence of the infection and surge of travel during the national holiday season, the COVID-19 disease began to spread quickly across China . Recognizing the problem, the Chinese government quickly took extreme measures to contain the spread of the virus, actions that included quarantining the entire city of Wuhan. Despite these efforts, however, the number of patients with COVID-19 rapidly increased. By Feb. 7, 2020, China had 31 161 patients diagnosed as COVID-19, with a large portion (22 112 cases) in Hubei Province with about half of those cases in the city of Wuhan (11 618 cases).",

The first case of COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province was diagnosed on Jan. 17, with the number of infections rapidly increasing after that date. Initially, these diagnosed patients were identified as having come from Wuhan. However, by Jan. 21, the first case of COVID-19 without Wuhan exposure was confirmed. Since then, the number of patients without Wuhan exposure gradually increased. At this time, very little was known about possible changes of epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the virus during human-to-human transmission.",

These viruses cause upper respiratory tract infections and pneumonia in humans and are rapidly transmitted from person to person. For example, another influenza, pandemic type A (H1N1), arose in early 2009 (probably in Mexico and the United States) and then reappeared in North America in September over a 7-month period. H1N1 kept mutating during human-to-human transmission, causing continuous severe disease and mortality (Deng et al., 2012; Vazquez-Perez et al., 2013) . Researchers found that adaptive mutations in H1N1 influenza virus in humans during the 2009 pandemic enhanced the virulence of the virus when studied in mice (Xu et al., 2011; Otte et al., 2015) . However, researchers currently do not know if the virulence and pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus increases or decreases during human-to-human transmission.",

Since early patients were not screened in Wuhan, it is difficult to determine the specific date of contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient; therefore, the incubation period could not be calculated for these patients. A total of 188 patients in the control group had a specific date of contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients and their calculated incubation period was 5 d (IQR: 3-9 d; range: 1-16 d). As shown in Fig. 1 , from the first case of COVID-19 diagnosed in Zhejiang Province on Jan. 17, the number of patients with exposure history of Wuhan gradually increased. By Jan. 21, the first case of COVID-19 without Wuhan exposure was confirmed and the number reached a peak by Jan. 28. After that date, the number of patients without Wuhan exposure history exceeded that of patients with Wuhan exposure history. After the strong epidemic prevention and control measures initiated by the Zhejiang government by Jan. 28, the epidemic began coming under control as evidenced by the concurrently decreasing number of cases. There was no COVID-19 patient with Wuhan exposure Patients with Wuhan exposure history as \"exposure group,\" and patients without Wuhan exposure history as \"control group.\" Data are presented as mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD), number (percentage), or median (interquartile range, IQR). COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; PCR: polymerase chain reaction history after Feb. 7. Our results showed that most patients' incubation time of COVID-19 was within two weeks. Because the COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan, the epidemiological history of patients was more complete in the exposure group than in the control group. In the exposure group, the time from onset of symptom to outpatient visit, qRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, and admission was shorter than that in the control group (P<0.05), with no significant differences in the degree of COVID-19 symptoms recorded (mild, severe, or critical). Table 2 shows the clinical characteristics of the patients. Fever (80.71%) and cough (64.21%) were the most common symptoms, followed by sputum production (33.63%), fatigue (17.64%), muscle ache (11.55%), gastrointestinal symptoms (11.17%), nasal obstruction (5.96%), shortness of breath (4.70%), and hemoptysis (1.90%).

Because of the high transmissibility of the virus, WHO classified this situation as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) Zhu et al., 2020) . On Jan. 23, 2020, China quarantined the entire city of Wuhan to contain the spread of COVID-19. Although the Chinese government made great efforts to control the spread of the epidemic, the epidemic continued to spread nationwide. Viral mutation can occur over successive humanto-human transmissions, increasing the probability of adaptation to human hosts during a pandemic outbreak and as a virus mutates, its virulence and pathogenicity may either increase or decrease (Wong et al., 2019) . One example of this is pandemic type A (H1N1) influenza which appeared in early 2009 and, as previously noted, reappeared in North America in September. Researchers have reported that an amino acid substitution in the hemagglutinin (HA), D222G, was present in a significant proportion of patients (Goka et al., 2014) . The data from Wuhan revealed high mortality of COVID-19. Chen et al. (2020) showed that 11 (11%) of 99 patients who contracted the disease worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure. Another study from Wuhan showed that among 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, 26% received ICU care with a mortality rate of 4.3% . In a study by Yang et al. (2020) (Wu and McGoogan, 2020) . At this time, the overall national mortality rate in China has been lower than that in Wuhan City.",

We also compared radiographic and laboratory findings of 788 COVID-19 patients with and without exposure to Wuhan, where only the differences in AST and LDH were statistically significant between the two groups. The differences in AST and LDH may be due to age differences between the groups since patients in the control group were older than those in the exposure group. Patients from Wuhan were diagnosed earlier because of a clear epidemiological history. In addition, patients with early onset had a history of Wuhan exposure and had a higher discharge rate. Therefore, from the perspective of epidemiological and clinical characteristics, no significant differences were found between COVD-19 patients with and without Wuhan exposure. The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients across the full range of Zhejiang Province is significantly lower than those directly in the city of Wuhan. The differences in mortality may be due to the early diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang Province, and the ICU-level care may be more readily available in Zhejiang Province, contributing to the improved survival.",
