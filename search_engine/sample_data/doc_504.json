      "text": "From Failure to the Top\n\nIn his first semester at university, everyone thought Ali was \u201cnot made for studies\u201d\u2014including Ali himself. He had failed two core subjects and barely passed the rest. His GPA was the lowest in his class. Each time results were announced, he avoided eye contact, pretending not to care, but inside he felt ashamed and lost.\n\nOne night, after seeing his results again, Ali sat alone in the library. Instead of blaming the system or his teachers, he asked himself one honest question: \u201cIf I continue like this, where will I end up?\u201d That moment became his turning point.\n\nAli didn\u2019t suddenly become a genius. He started small. He attended every lecture, even when he felt behind. He rewrote his notes after class, asked questions he once felt embarrassed to ask, and practiced problems daily instead of cramming before exams. He failed quizzes along the way, but this time he treated failure as feedback, not proof of weakness.\n\nSlowly, things changed. His grades improved\u2014not dramatically at first, but steadily. By the end of the second year, Ali wasn\u2019t just passing; he was topping assignments. In his final year, something unbelievable happened: Ali graduated with the highest GPA in his department.\n\nWhen asked about his success, he smiled and said,\n\u201cFailure didn\u2019t mean I was incapable. It meant I hadn\u2019t learned how to try properly yet.\u201d\n\nHis story became proof that one bad semester\u2014or even several\u2014does not define a student. Persistence does."
